✅ Done
🐞 Bug
💪 Enhancement
```

🐞

🐞 Mouse cursor directional movement isn't smooth enough. The ship randomly swings around when moving in a circle.

🐞 `spawn_randomly_at()` while loop has a bug where every once in a while `_colliding` is always true so the loop never exits.

💪 Find animated bullet sprite or use a scaled down version of meteor sprites?

💪 Make worm hole progress bar shrink when not clicking it.

💪 Make worm hole spawn you into a new room when progress hits 100%
